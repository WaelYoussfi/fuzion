The Fuzion language implementation
==================================

This is work under development, documentation is mostly not existing.

Please check https://flang.dev for language and implementation design.

To clone the repository:

  > git clone https://github.com/fridis/fuzion

Note that the current directly must not contain any spaces.

Requirements:

 - OpenJDK 16, e.g., https://adoptopenjdk.net/releases.html?variant=openjdk16&jvmVariant=hotspot
 - clang-10 LLVM C compiler (on ubuntu: sudo apt-get install clang-10)

To build:

Make sure java/javac commands from OpenJDK 16 and clang 10 binary are in $PATH.  Then do:

  > cd fuzion
  > make

alternatively, you can build in another directory and use

  > make -f <fuzion-dir>/fuzion/Makefile

To run an example after a successful build:

  > cd build
  > export PATH=$PWD/bin:$PATH
  > cd tests/rosettacode_factors_of_an_integer
  > fz factors

To compile the same example (requires clang C compiler):

  > fz -c factors
  > ./factors

Have fun!
