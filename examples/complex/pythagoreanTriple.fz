# For any complex number v with v.r/v.i integers, v.abs² is also an
# integer.  Since v² has absolute v².r and v².i, and v².abs = v.abs²,
# we find a pythagorean triple (v².r, v².i, v².abs) for every such v.
#
pythagoreanTriple is

  max := 100

  for r in 1..max do
    for
      # i >= r is not interesting, v².r or v².i would be negative
      # so we start end i at r-1
      i in 1..r-1
      t := triple r i
      a := t.a
      b := t.b
      c := t.c
    while c < max
      if r.gcd i = 1 # filter duplicates
        say "{a}² + {b}² = {c}² = {a*a} + {b*b} = {c*c}"

  triple(r, i i32) is
    v := complex r i
    v² := v * v
    f := v².r.gcd v².i  # 1 or 2 (if r+i is even)
    a := v².r / f
    b := v².i / f
    c := v.abs² / f
