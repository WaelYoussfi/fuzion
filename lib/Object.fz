# Object -- parent feature of all features that do not have an explicit parent
#
Object ref is

  # NYI: For now, === and !== are used for ref equality checks, = and /= for value equality
  infix === (o Object) bool is intrinsic
  infix !== (o Object) bool is intrinsic

  hashCode i32 is intrinsic
  asString string is intrinsic
  prefix $ => Object.this.asString

  # NYI: Currently, only intrinsic features are permitted in Object. The reason is
  # that any feature in Object would also inherit from object, so the frame
  # object of that feature would inherit its outer feature, which would cause
  # problems in case of recursion, see tests/inheritance_negative2.fz
