# hasEquals -- feature for that allows comparison using 'infix =' operator.
#
# features inheriting from this feature must be immutable. The operator
# 'infix =' provides a means to separate values into equivalence classes.
#
# NYI: the compiler should check that features inheriting from this are
# actually immutable.
#
hasEquals<T: hasEquals<T>> is

  # equality check for immutable values
  #
  infix = (o T) bool is abstract

  # unequality check for immutable values
  #
  infix /= (o T) bool
    post
      result <=> !(hasEquals.this = o)
  is
    !(hasEquals.this = o)

  # alternative unicode operator for 'infix /='
  #
  infix â‰  (o T) => hasEquals.this /= o
