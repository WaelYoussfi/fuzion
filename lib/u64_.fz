# u64 -- returns value of unit type u64s
#
# This is a convenience feature that allows using, e.g., 'u64.sum' to
# get the the monoid of (u64, infix +) instead of 'u64s.sum'.
#
# since this u64 with no arguments is a routine and not a constructor, it
# does not define a type (which would cause a name clash with u64 with one
# argument).

u64 => u64s
