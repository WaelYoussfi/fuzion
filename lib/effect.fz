# effect -- abstract parent feature for effects
#
# effect provides a means to perform effectful operations.  Instances
# of effect are installed in the current environment while their code is
# executed.  The code may access the effect via <type>.env.
#
effect
  # NYI: ,aybe onewayMonad should better inherit from effect
  : onewayMonad<unit, effect> (onewayMonadMode.inst code)
is

  # the code to be executed within this effect.  This is typically
  # redefined as an argument field of a sub-feature of effect.
  #
  # NYI: Currently, there is no direct way to return a result value
  # from the code.
