# u8 -- returns value of unit type u8s
#
# This is a convenience feature that allows using, e.g., 'u8.sum' to
# get the the monoid of (u8, infix +) instead of 'u8s.sum'.
#
# since this u8 with no arguments is a routine and not a constructor, it
# does not define a type (which would cause a name clash with u8 with one
# argument).

u8 => u8s
