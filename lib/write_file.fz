# write_file -- shortcut for io.file.write
#
# A handy shortcut for io.file.write, creates a new file using an array of u8 as
# content and a string as the file path
# it overwrites the file, if it exists, or creates a new one if it does not exist
# if the director(y/ies) in the path d(oes/o) not exist, no file shall be created
#
