# orderedMap -- an immutable map from ordered keys K to values V
#
# Lookup performance is O(log size) since it uses binary search in a
# sorted array.  When deterministic performance is desired, an ordered map
# should be preferred over a hash map.
#
# performance of creation of the map is in O(n log n) where n is
# keys.length.
