# -----------------------------------------------------------------------

# i16 -- returns value of unit type i16s
#
# This is a convenience feature that allows using, e.g., 'i16.sum' to
# get the the monoid of (i16, infix +) instead of 'i16s.sum'.
#
# since this i16 with no arguments is a routine and not a constructor, it
# does not define a type (which would cause a name clash with i16 with one
# argument).

i16 => i16s
