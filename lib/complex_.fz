# complex -- returns value of unit type complexes
#
# This is a convenience feature that allows using, e.g.,
# 'complex<i32>.sum' to get the the monoid of (complex, infix +) instead of
# 'complexs.sum'.
#
# Since this complex with no arguments is a routine and not a constructor, it
# does not define a type (which would cause a name clash with complex with two
# arguments).

complex<E: numeric<E>> => complexes<E>
