# Note that this value is of type >>FALSE<<, not of type >>bool<<, i.e., if it
# is used for type inference as in
#
#    myBoolean := FALSE
#
# you will get a variable of type >>FALSE<<, it will not be possible to assign
# >>TRUE<< to it. You can use >>false<< as an alternative to get type >>bool<<.
