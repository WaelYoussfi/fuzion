# i8 -- returns value of unit type i8s
#
# This is a convenience feature that allows using, e.g., 'i8.sum' to
# get the the monoid of (i8, infix +) instead of 'i8s.sum'.
#
# since this i8 with no arguments is a routine and not a constructor, it
# does not define a type (which would cause a name clash with i8 with one
# argument).
#
i8 => i8s
